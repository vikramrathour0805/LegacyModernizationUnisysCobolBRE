  Program: ALGOL_MAC_CALC
  Author: Gemini
  Date: 2024-08-13

  Purpose:
  This program calculates a simple Message Authentication Code (MAC)
  based on an input message and a secret key. It is designed to be
  called from a COBOL program.

  The algorithm is a basic iterative XOR checksum, simulating a more
  complex cryptographic process like CBC-MAC.

  PROCEDURE MAC_CALCULATOR(MESSAGE, KEY, MAC_RESULT);
    VALUE MESSAGE, KEY;
    STRING MESSAGE, KEY, MAC_RESULT;
  BEGIN
    COMMENT
    Procedure to calculate the MAC.
    - MESSAGE: The input message string from COBOL.
    - KEY: The secret key for the calculation.
    - MAC_RESULT: The output string where the result is stored.
    ;

    INTEGER I, J, MSG_LEN, KEY_LEN, CURRENT_CHAR_VAL;
    INTEGER ARRAY MAC_BLOCK[1:8];

    MSG_LEN := LENGTH(MESSAGE);
    KEY_LEN := LENGTH(KEY);

    COMMENT Initialize the MAC block with the key values;
    FOR I := 1 STEP 1 UNTIL 8 DO
    BEGIN
      MAC_BLOCK[I] := RANK(KEY[I]);
    END;

    COMMENT
    Iterate through the message, XORing each character with the
    current MAC block. This is the core of the algorithm.
    ;
    FOR I := 1 STEP 1 UNTIL MSG_LEN DO
    BEGIN
      CURRENT_CHAR_VAL := RANK(MESSAGE[I]);
      J := ((I - 1) MOD 8) + 1;
      MAC_BLOCK[J] := BITXOR(MAC_BLOCK[J], CURRENT_CHAR_VAL);
    END;

    COMMENT Convert the final integer block back to a character string;
    FOR I := 1 STEP 1 UNTIL 8 DO
    BEGIN
      MAC_RESULT[I] := CHR(MAC_BLOCK[I]);
    END;

  END; COMMENT End of MAC_CALCULATOR procedure;

  COMMENT
  Main block of the program. In a real environment, this would
  handle the interface with the calling COBOL program to get the
  parameters. For this simulation, we assume the procedure is
  called directly with the correct parameters.
